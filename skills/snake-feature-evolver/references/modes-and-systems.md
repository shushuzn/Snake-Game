# Snake Modes & Systems Reference Index

Use this index to load only the reference file needed for the current task.

## Reference file distribution

- `references/module-map.md`
  - Modes and module ownership map.
  - Version synchronization touchpoints.
- `references/persistence-and-account.md`
  - Current storage keys.
  - Persistence/account compatibility checklist.
- `references/integration-checklists.md`
  - Feature-by-feature integration checklists (pickup, challenge/season/event, workshop).

## Loading guidance

- Mode changes: read `module-map.md` + `persistence-and-account.md`.
- New storage key: read `persistence-and-account.md`.
- New mechanic/pickup/event/workshop: read `integration-checklists.md` and only relevant section.
